# Golden Nodes, by Golden Ratio Staking

This github is a live WIP for Tendermint based chains filled with:
- Beginners steps to node running
- Tips/tricks I've learned from people smarter than me (and through my own mistakes)
- Scripts for setting up nodes, relayers, seeds, RPC & REST endpoints, etc
